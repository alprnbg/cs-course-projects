This is an implementation of a simple database design.



To run the database, run the following command.

python3 src/storageManager.py inputFile outputFile



In src folder, there is a system catalog file which was already reset. However, if you want to reset the database after some operations, you should run the following command.
(You can also give the name of the database and the name of the owner)

python3 src/storageManager.py reset "db_name" "owner_name"
